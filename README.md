# Table-Detection-and-Table-Structure-Recognition

Table detection and information extraction from
table images has always been an arduous task because of the
wide range of table images in different images and sizes. The
proposed technique for table detection and information extraction
used a novel approach of object detection trained on publicly
available ICDAR 2013 [1] dataset. We increased the efficiency of
this proposed architecture by using image segmentation instead
of object detection and by applying advanced image processing
algorithms on both the dataset as well as the resulting masks
from our model. The above-mentioned techniques were applied
on the Marmot Extended for Table Structure Recognition, which
was made publicly available by S. Paliwal.

The proposed model pipeline was:
